## Introduction
Pokémon Uranium development started around 2006 using RPG Maker XP, which as you might guess was designed for Windows XP. The game doesn’t run great on some modern computers and operating systems due to compatibility issues, and the binary is Windows-only. **But [wine](https://www.winehq.org) can run some Windows-only software, and Pokémon Uranium is supported! Wine may even run the game better than Windows installed on the same computer via Bootcamp!** Here I’ll detail the steps you need to take to install and run Pokémon Uranium on your Mac.

This document is based off [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonuranium/comments/6sj2rk/installing_and_playing_pokemon_uranium_with_wine/), which dealt with running Pokémon Uranium in Wine under Linux. It has been significantly expanded to help less experienced users.

### What to expect
I’ve tested Pokémon Uranium in VMWare Fusion (Windows XP VM), Wine and Bootcamp (running Windows 10 natively on my MacBook Pro). This is what I found:

#### Windows XP virtual machine:
- Almost completely unplayable, messed up audio and very laggy

#### Windows 10:
- Skips frames regularly (GPU is a Radeon Pro 455, which is more than capable enough for this)
- Has a weird menu bug where menu navigation slows to around 1 option per second (making changing controls painful)
- Has the well known line bug on a 4k display:
	- > Some people have been having problems with weird lines appearing while in fullscreen mode. I am aware of this bug and am attempting to fix it. Until then the temporary fix is to enable "Run in 640 x 480 screen resolution" in the Uranium.exe compatibility settings (This has also been known to reduce lag slightly). (<https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonuranium/comments/525uk9/official_unofficial_patch_and_server_thread/>, 2018)

#### macOS 10.13.3 via Wine:
- Runs fairly smoothly
	- Expect a few dropped frames, but fewer than with Windows
- Doesn’t have the menu slowness bug
- Doesn’t have the line bug


## Requirements
- macOS 10.13.3+ (not tested on earlier versions, may work but no guarantees)
- Administrator privileges
- A reasonably modern Mac, the faster the better
	- I’ll keep this guide up to date with user reports, if you want to help make this guide better please see the contributing section at the end
- A vague knowledge of UNIX and the Terminal (helpful for troubleshooting but not strictly necessary if you follow this exactly and everything works)
- A copy of the current Pokémon Uranium files (the folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Pokemon\Uranium` on a Windows install)
	- Wine cannot be used to run the installer
	- You need to download the portable version from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonuranium/comments/54dodq/updated_installer_patch_installers/) later on


## ① Tools
Install each tool in order.

**Note that `~` means your home directory in UNIX, so `~/pokemon_uranium` translates to `/Users/<username/pokemon_uranium`. You can access your home directory by pressing CMD+SHIFT+H.**

⏱ Timings assume you have ~100Mb download speed

### Homebrew
⏱ This step will take about 5 minutes

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that makes it easy to install, update and manage some pieces of command-line software.

- Open Terminal
- Paste `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` and hit enter
- If prompted, hit enter to install the XCode Command Line Tools and enter your password
- Allow the installer to complete

### XQuartz
⏱ This step will take about 5 minutes

[XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) is required for Wine to run properly.

- Go to [the download page](https://www.xquartz.org) and download the most recent .dmg file
- Run the .pkg file inside the downloaded file and follow the instructions.
- You don’t need to reboot yet but you will before you run the game.

###  Wine Staging
⏱ This step will take about 5 minutes

> Wine (recursive backronym for Wine Is Not an Emulator) is a free and open-source compatibility layer that aims to allow computer programs (application software and computer games) developed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems. (Wikipedia, 2018)

Wine Staging is the testing area of Wine, where new features and bugs come first. At the time of writing, you must use Wine Staging to install as Wine Stable throws a fatal error.

- Go to [the download page](https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/macosx/download.html) and download `Installer for “Wine Staging”`
- Run the .pkg file once it has downloaded
- During installation, tick the `64 bit support (optional)` box.

### Winetricks
⏱ This step will take about 2 minutes

> Winetricks is a helper script to download and install various redistributable runtime libraries needed to run some programs in Wine. These may include replacements for components of Wine using closed source libraries. (WineHQ Wiki, 2018)

- Open Terminal
- Type `brew install winetricks` and hit enter
- That’s it! This is why Homebrew is awesome.

## ② Game Installation
### Restart
Before continuing, restart to allow your Mac to use the newly installed XQuartz software.

### Create virtual Windows installation
⏱ This step will take about 20 minutes

- Run the following commands in order (you can copy and paste the whole block)
	- Lines starting with a `#` are comments and will be ignored by Terminal
- You will be able to move the `~/pokemon_uranium` folder (which will contain the game and Wine configuration) to your preferred location once everything is ready
- When wineboot runs, **accept the on-screen prompts to install Mono and Gecko**
- Lots of warnings/errors will be shown in Terminal, don’t worry about these
- Wait until the Mono/Gecko installation has completed before continuing

```bash
# add Wine to path temporarily
export PATH=$PATH:"/Applications/Wine Staging.app/Contents/Resources/wine/bin/"
# make game folder
mkdir ~/pokemon_uranium
# set WINEPREFIX to point to folder
export WINEPREFIX=~/pokemon_uranium
# enter folder
cd $WINEPREFIX
# run wineboot
wineboot
# install DLLs
winetricks directplay directmusic dsound d3dx9_36 devenum dmsynth quartz
# remove cache files
rm -rf ~/.cache/wine ~/.cache/winetricks
```

### Add the game to the virtual Windows installation
⏱ This step will take about 5 minutes

- Option A:
	- Go to [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemonuranium/comments/54dodq/updated_installer_patch_installers/) and click on the **Portable** link to download the game files.
		- The installer doesn’t work under Wine so it needs to be the portable version!
	- Extract the zip file once it has downloaded by double clicking on it (this might happen automatically depending on how your Mac is set up)
- Option B:
	- Install Pokémon Uranium on a Windows computer
	- Copy the folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Pokemon Uranium` to your Mac
- In Finder press SHIFT+CMD+G and type `~/pokemon_uranium/drive_c/Program Files (x86)` into the box, then hit enter
- Move the `Pokemon Uranium` folder from whichever option you chose to **the folder you are now in**

### Run the game once to install fonts
⏱ This step will take about 5 minutes

- Download the `Run Pokémon Uranium.command` file from this Git repository by clicking the green `Clone or Download` button in the top right and selecting `Download ZIP`
- Extract the .zip file (this might happen automatically depending on how your Mac is set up)
- Move `Run Pokémon Uranium.command` in the resulting folder to `~/pokemon_uranium/Run Pokémon Uranium.command` 
- Run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "~/pokemon_uranium/Run Pokémon Uranium.command"` in the Terminal
	- This step removes (for this file only) the ‘unidentified developer’ that otherwise occurs when you try and run a file downloaded from the internet
- Double click the file to start Pokémon Uranium
- The fonts will look a bit weird on this first run. The game will automatically install the fonts it needs at this point. Press enter to accept when the game asks you if you want to restart it. It will close (and doesn’t automatically restart).

### Move the game to your preferred folder
You can leave the game in `~/pokemon_uranium`, but if you want to move it to (for example) `~/Documents/Pokémon Uranium` you can now do so through Finder.

## ③ Play the game 😄👏
- Every time you want to play, double click `Run Pokémon Uranium.command` in your game directory to start it
- You can also drag `Run Pokémon Uranium.command` to the right side of your Dock (next to the Trash)
- When the game has launched you can close Terminal safely
- Your saves are in `<game directory>/drive_c/users/<username>/Saved Games/Pokemon Uranium`.

### Known issues
- Fullscreen mode causes the game to slow down significantly. An alternative to fullscreen is to set the window to Large, and go to `System Preferences → Accessibility → Zoom → Use scroll gesture with modifier keys to zoom`, then zoom into the game using your chosen modifier key and a scroll wheel / pinch on the trackpad.
